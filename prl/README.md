# Modeling the PRL size as a markov chain

This directory contains the scripts that were used to calculate, aggregate, and
plot the figures regarding the markov model.

At the core of this directory stands the `main.py` script that takes different
parameters for `n`, `p`, and `e` (in the paper called T_prl). Based on these
parameters, the script calculates the G and L probabilities, and combines them
into the markov matrix. Finally, it solves the linear equation to gain the
stationary distribution and can also plot the individual probabilities per
state. In the paper, multiple of these stationary distributions were then
aggregated into a single plot and the plots of individual state probabilities
were not used.

Since runs can take a few minutes, the script allows to set up a cache directory
where the markov matrix is stored as a Python pickle file. This allows the other
scripts to quickly parse and plot multiple runs without needing to recompute the
whole matrices.

## Reference outputs

In the folder `reference-outputs`, we provice the reference outputs that were
generated by the below commands on our local machine. These outputs were also
the source for the plots in the paper.

## Runtime

Generating the individual markov matrices takes some but not an excessive amount
of time. To speed it up a little bit, we parallelized the below scripts and made
sure to cache generated results so that they can be reused by the next scripts
(since the results are deterministic). Thus, usually only the first run of a
script takes a long time and all successive runs are immediate since they can
simply reload the cached data from disk.

Here is a short overview as a reference how long each Makefile target took on
our development machine. Note, that `make all` will be slightly faster than the
sum of the individual commands since there is an overlap in the generated data
and the scripts automatically skip what is already generated. So the more data
you have already generated, the faster the scripts will complete.

| Target           | Time |
| :--------------- | :--  |
| test             | 1 second    |
| probabilities    | 1 second    |
| tikz             | 1 second    |
| single           | 3 minutes   |
| tv-distribution  | 18 minutes  |
| p-plot           | 16 minutes  |
| n-plot           | 26 minutes  |
| t-plot           | 90 minutes  |


## Docker setup

The Makefile provides multiple targets to evaluate and reuse the artifact and
can also be used as a point of reference for the individual elements in the
paper.

**We strongly suggest to not immediately run `make all` as that will take a
long time to complete**. 

Since we did not optimize these scripts, they may hog resources. If you prefer
to just let this run and com back later, of course feel free to run `make all`
and check back after a few hours.

By default, all plots will be saved to the `./plots` directory. You can override
this by setting the `PLOT_DIR` variable when running the `make` commands.

### Setup

The PRL scripts use a Docker container with Python 3.8 and all requirements
pre-installed. To test it out, run:

```bash
make test
```

Once this very small example executes correctly, attempt to generate a single
distribution (i.e. reproduce a single data point of one of the Markov Chain
graphs in the paper):

```bash
make single
```

On our local laptop, this single distribution requires ~3 minutes to generate.
The following targets thus parallelize the generation of markov matrices and
will use all threads on a system.

### Reproduce graphs

To reproduce all graphs in the paper, we provide individual targets for each
plot:

```bash
# Plot series over the different probabilities
make p-plot
# Plot series over the number of pseudonyms
make n-plot
# Plot series over the time each pseudonym stays in the list
make t-plot
# Generate distribution for Tv
make tv-distribution

# Or, run all at once (will take some time).
make all

# Once all data has been generated, the make commands will also run quick as they can reuse the cached versions
```

### Simple tikz plot

The appendix lists a simple transition graph (Fig. 9). The LaTeX Tikz code for
this can be generated with:

```bash
make tikz
```

### Cleanup

To delete all files (cache files and plots), simply run `make clean`.

## Local setup

The scripts all utilize Python. Our system runs Python 3.8.10 and newer Python
versions may not work properly due to changes to the asyncio library used by the
`generate_plots.py` script. This should only affect convenient generation of
multiple settings at the same time and should not impact the core `main.py`
script.

To get started, simply install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Generating a single stationary distribution

Run one iteration of the main script like this:

```bash
python3 main.py -n 800 -p 0.0001 -e 30 --cache-dir=cached/ --force-cached -g
```

`--help` gives more information but `n`, `p`, and `e` (T_prl) are defined as in
the paper while `--cache-dir` defines the caching directory, `--force-cached`
prevents recomputation and only relies on the data already in the `cached`
folder, and `-g` instructs to plot the stationary distribution of these
parameters.

## Generating the first plot of the paper

The first plot of the paper depicts multiple scenarios that vary in their
probability and visualizes different percentiles. The script
`p-plot_generator.py` performs this operation, generates a plot and also creates
a tikz export. Simply run it with `python3 p-plot_generator.py` (assuming the
cached markov matrices are in `cached`). The `p-plot_generator.py` script will
abort if it can not load all the required data points from the `cached`
directory. Thus, to run it, you must first generate this data.

The `make p-plot` target does this by generating the individual data first, see
below for how to do this manually.


### Reproducing the data used in the first plot

The appendix explains more in-depth how the probabilities were calculated. The
probabilities that we used can be re-computed by running the `probabilities.py`
script (via `make probabilities`). This will also print the number of expected
revocations for each scenario, as discussed in Section VII-B. The script should
give as output the following probabilities:

```text
Scenario 1: pseudonyms get revoked at least once a day with 1% probability
0.000000116323325
0.000007813830433
0.000015511337541
0.000038603858866
0.000077091394407
0.000154066465489

Scenario 2: pseudonyms get revoked at least once a day with 99% probability
0.000053299160406
0.000060464839143
0.000067630517880
0.000089127554093
0.000124955947779
0.000196612735153
```

Then, multiple plots can be generated at the same time with the
`generate_plots.py` script (careful, only with python up to 3.8), which is
wrapped in the [p-plot.sh](./scripts/p-plot.sh) script.

```bash
# Probability plot (Fig. 6)
./scripts/p-plot.sh
```

If you happen to not want to use the `generate_plots.py` script (i.e. due to
Python > 3.8), you can also call `main.py` multiple times with `-e 30 -n 800`
and `-p` set to each option included in the `generate_plots.py` calls.

## Reproducing the data used in the Tv plot

For the plot that shows the size of the HB in relation to the value of Tv (cf.
Section VII-C), we used the data for the PRL size from the worst possible
scenario, i.e., Scenario 2 with 20% attackers, with probability
`0.000196612735153`. For this data, we used a fixed value `n` of 800 and the
following values for `e` (T_prl): `[30, 150, 300, 900]`.

The data can be obtained by running the
[tv-distribution.sh](./scripts/tv-distribution.sh) script:

```bash
# T_v distribution (Fig. 7)
./scripts/tv-distribution.sh
```

## Generating the appendix plots of the paper

Besides varying the probability, the paper also contains plots that vary `n` and
`e` (T_prl). This is done by the scripts `python3 t-plot_generator.py` and
`python3 n-plot_generator.py` that work in a similar fashion as the previous
plot script.

### Reproducing the data used in the appendix plots

For the appendix plots we used the [n-plot.sh](./scripts/n-plot.sh) and
[t-plot.sh](./scripts/t-plot.sh) scripts.

```bash
# n (number of pseudonyms) plot (Fig. 11)
./scripts/n-plot.sh

# T_PRL plot (Fig. 10)
./scripts/t-plot.sh
```

## Generating the visualization of a markov matrix

The `main.py` script can also generate the tikz graph that is used in the
appendix to visualize our markov chain. Simply call it with the `-f
tikz_file_name.tex` option. Beware that large graphs may crash PDFtex or are not
visualized correctly. But since large graphs are not very readable anyway, we
opted for small parameters yielding to the command:

```bash
python3 main.py -n 3 -p 0.01 -e 2 -f tikz-graph.tex
```
